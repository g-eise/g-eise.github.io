The Male Social Hierarchy stems from organizational patterns studied by scholars, mainly psychologists and philosophers, who believe that men form themselves within this hierarchy through displays of their status. The ones who are the bast at establishing their masculine identity in a collaborative manner that is accepted by those beneath them on the hierarchy are the ones who will find their position at the top (Flood, 2008, 339).

When the suitors\u2019 parents, who would be his peers confront him, the fight is stopped by Athena who wipes their memories (Ibid, 24.545-550). This phenomenon is explained best with Nietzsche\u2019s Apollonian-Dionysian theory. What this discusses is the duality between one\u2019s civilized and uncivilized aspects (Carlevale, 2006, 364). If one gives way to the uncivilized side, they form a violent, tribal union like the Male Social Hierarchy, if they hold onto logic, reason, and their civilized aspects, they also reject the formation of the hierarchy itself an become an outlier (Gleason, 2002, 9).

Unlike The Willing Outlier, they lack in certain physical capabilities that prohibit their ability to have the abilities to ever be at the top of the hierarchy. For \u2018Piggy\u2019 from Lord of The Flies and Telemachus from The Odyssey, their weakness falls on their lack of physical capabilities. This is an evident flaw for \u2018Piggy\u2019 as his weight was even the origin of his nickname which is the only title the reader ever receives for him (Golding, 1953,12). In comparison, Telemachus is bullied by the other suitors for his inability to live up to his father\u2019s stature (Homer, Odyssey, 2.40-65). Even so, Piggy is still intelligent enough to advice Ralph when making important decisions and Telemachus is under the watch of Athena, meaning that he may not have his father\u2019s strength but has the same intelligence (Golding, 1953, 290; Homer, Odyssey, 2.405-6)."}),Object(C.jsx)("p",{children:"This means that The Brain is not a member of the hierarchy who is one of the strongest, but based on their intelligence, not fully incapable of proving themselves to the other members as well.

Therefore, one must look at these characters motives for finding themselves at the bottom of the hierarchy. Scholars, Karen May and David Upton describe that characters such as Piggy and Telemachus attach themselves to The Willing Outliers in order to survive the hierarchy itself (May and Upton, 2015, 71). Their lack of physical abilities and heightened intelligence make them subversive to the \u2018Dionysian\u2019 actions that less intelligent, and physically capable characters would be more susceptible too but they cannot defend themselves the way The Willing Outlier can. Therefore, though these characters make an intellectual decision to stay outside of the hierarchy, they are still reliant on The Willing Outlier to give them security in that position.

In the case of the Suitors from The Odyssey, the central game that they play amongst one another is who can marry Penelope, Odysseus\u2019s wife, and through this claim his entire kingdom (Homer, Odyssey, 1.332). This idea of Game Theory can be extended to Lord of The Flies since their task of survival is ultimately treated like a game to engage the younger children of the story (Golding, 1953, 47). Without the use of game theory, these groups would not be able to function and establish one\u2019s place on the social hierarchy. This is directly related to the importance of one\u2019s physical capabilities in the games, as mentioned in the previous section, since many of their tasks require physical effort to be completed.
