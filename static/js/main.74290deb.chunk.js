This is shown through the other Choir Boys joining in on the killing of the pig and The Suitors laughing at the stool being thrown at Odysseus (Golding, 1953, 192-6; Hom.Od.18.397ff). Rifaat Salih describes \u2018The Eye\u2019 as characters that are the least connected to their civilized roots, even more than The King (Rifaat, 2019, 42).

Despite the uncivilised actions The King may adopt, he is not completely removed from his civilized side. He is more charismatic and manipulative than those beneath him and also exhibits strong athletic abilities. His charisma and talents are the factors which invite the other members of The Male Social Hierarchy to follow him and therefore, allot the most power to the character. "}),Object(H.jsxs)("p",{children:["Antinous, from ",Object(H.jsx)("em",{children:"The Odyssey"}),", and Jack, from ",Object(H.jsx)("em",{children:"Lord of The Flies"}),", are the members who take this role. They are the ones that form the hierarchy after taking the power away from The Willing Outliers. This is shown when Antinous is described as the most likely to court Penelope and when Jack introduces the idea of the hunt (Hom.Od.18-285-290; Golding, 1953,47). When these characters come to power, they introduce the \u2018battle mentality\u2019 that the rest of The Family adopts. This demonstrates his show of charisma since none of the other suitors are seen making romantic gestures such as this towards her to achieve the same goal. One example of this is when Antinous is shown being the first member of the group to put down Telemachus when he speaks up against the suitors which the others quickly join in (Hom.Od.1.381-8).By being the first to outcast Telemachus at the beginning of the Epic, he is established as the \u2018winner\u2019 of their collective battle task and the most socially capable of The Suitors. Furthermore, by being the first to speak, Antinous is also presented at the top of the \u201cproper order\u201d, which references the Male Social Hierarchy, demonstrates that he is the leader of the group (Ibid, 1.145). Additionally, he is also one of the few characters to laugh on his own without the influence of the rest of the group, furthering the example of his social capacity in establishing dominance. Jack also displays these traits by placing emphasis on the boys \u2018fun\u2019 rather than completing tasks that would be beneficial to their survival such as building huts. This influences the other Choir Boys into following him throughout the rest of the story (Golding, 1953, 47). Therefore, one can deduce that the use of charisma places \u2018The King\u2019 at the top of the hierarchy and creates the greatest influence over the rest of the characters.
