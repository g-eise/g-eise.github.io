Hello, if you’ve just made it to this part of the website there are probably a lot of questions, you’re asking yourself right now such as: \n        </p>\n        <ol>\n            <li>What is this?</li>\n            <li>What’s it’s point?</li>\n            <li>Who is No.4?</li>\n        </ol>\n        <p>\n        Since this is the shortest to answer, I’ll start with the ladder: No.4 is you, and who you are to the other characters on this page. Really, your name isn’t all that special. You have four freckles and therefore, you got to be No.4 because of it! \n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Now I should answer the other two: What is this? Well, unfortunately one way or another you have found yourself dead centre in what will be coined on this website as ‘The Male Social Hierarchy’. Keeping the dry, science part aside, ‘The Male Social Hierarchy’ can be defined as a way human being, in this case fictional upper class white men, organize themselves to create a sense of security through their unity. The Male Social Hierarchy stems from organizational patterns studied by scholars, mainly psychologists and philosophers, who believe that men form themselves within this hierarchy through displays of their status. The ones who are the bast at establishing their masculine identity in a collaborative manner that is accepted by those beneath them on the hierarchy are the ones who will find their position at the top (Flood, 2008, 339). Often, the establishment of this function described as being done through men’s sexual prowess but really, any factor that allows men to re-establish their masculinity can have this function. No.4, you are in the middle of the hierarchy. Not too great, but not to terrible either. If it’s any condolence, at least you’re not at the bottom, right? \n        </p>\n        <p>\n        There are two, rather infamous, Male Social Hierarchies that describe best describes what happens when this social order is established; the Choir Boys from William Goulding’s ‘Lord of The Flies’ and the group of suitors from Homers ‘Odyssey’. Both these groups have a lot in common; they both were written about after major wars, both are upper-class, both are practically isolated on an island, both choose specific people to leave out of their hierarchy and lastly, thrive off violence. The list of traits these two groups have in common once their social hierarchy is established can go on for a while. Additionally, No.4, both these groups are meant to represent you and your hierarchy. What will we uncover together on this website is what factors make ‘The Male Social Hierarchy’ end up this way? And what does this mean for people outside of the fictional realm? In this study, we will explore the choices of the individual, the purpose of unity, and the influence of the elites as factors that form The Male Social Hierarchy. \n        </p>\n        </div>\n    },\n    {\n        header: 'On the Outskirts Part 1',\n        title: 'The Willing Outlier',\n        photo: '2.png',\n        position: { x: 200, y: 300 },\n        content: <div>\n            <p>\n            First, let’s look at the bottom of the social hierarchy: There are different ways that characters can end up in this position but what they have in common is that theology can explain how they got there. When looking at the bottom of the hierarchy, there are many differences between these characters. Some willingly distinguish themselves from the rest of the group despite their physical and mental capabilities, some are there for a lack of one of those two traits and some are pushed into this role. What separates these characters from the others is their ability to maintain their civil behavior and attitudes. Let’s look first at ‘The Willing Outlier’:\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            No.4, remember on the last page how I mentioned that you are somewhere in the middle of the hierarchy and essentially, unimportant? Well, unlike you The Willing Outlier is important, possibly even the most important in the entire hierarchy. Therefore, he is represented by the protagonists of both these stories like Ralph in Lord of the Flies and Odysseus in the Odyssey. These characters have two important traits in common: their equal abilities to the leader of the hierarchy and their support in civil backing. To expand: \n            </p>\n            <p>\n            At the end of both works, Odysseus and Ralph are pitted against their peers. Ralph is during fighting the leader of his hierarchy, Jack before a soldier comes and stops them, ultimately saving the boys (Golding, 1953, 287). Furthermore, Odysseus defeats the suitors, the main social hierarchy in this analysis, but since most of these characters are younger than him, they cannot be considered his peers, meaning the was not fighting an equal (Homer, Odyssey, 22.285-90). When the suitors’ parents, who would be his peers confront him, the fight is stopped by Athena who wipes their memories (Ibid, 24.545-550). This phenomenon is explained best with Nietzsche’s Apollonian-Dionysian theory. What this discusses is the duality between one’s civilized and uncivilized aspects (Carlevale, 2006, 364). If one gives way to the uncivilized side, they form a violent, tribal union like the Male Social Hierarchy, if they hold onto logic, reason, and their civilized aspects, they also reject the formation of the hierarchy itself an become an outlier (Gleason, 2002, 9). Therefore, Ralph and Odysseus are representative of the ‘purest’ form of Nietzsche’s ideals since they choose the ‘Apollonian’, orderly, side of his view rather than the ‘Dionysian’, disorderly, views despite their obvious abilities to be leaders.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            This information communicates that those at the top of the ‘Male Social Hierarchy’ reject conventional societal order and rather, create a order in ‘Apollonian terms’  \n            </p>\n        </div>\n    },\n    {\n        header: 'On the Outskirts Part 2',\n        title: 'The Brain',\n        photo: '3.png',\n        position: { x: 100, y: 300 },\n        content: <div>\n            <p>\n            Alright, now that we’ve covered the high-and-mighty Willing Outlier let’s look at The Brain. While The Brain still makes the active decision to choose their ‘Apollonian’ side over the Dionysian one, they are somewhat more restricted to this role. Unlike The Willing Outlier, they lack in certain physical capabilities that prohibit their ability to have the abilities to ever be at the top of the hierarchy. For ‘Piggy’ from Lord of The Flies and Telemachus from The Odyssey, their weakness falls on their lack of physical capabilities. This is an evident flaw for ‘Piggy’ as his weight was even the origin of his nickname which is the only title the reader ever receives for him (Golding, 1953,12). In comparison, Telemachus is bullied by the other suitors for his inability to live up to his father’s stature (Homer, Odyssey, 2.40-65). Even so, Piggy is still intelligent enough to advice Ralph when making important decisions and Telemachus is under the watch of Athena, meaning that he may not have his father’s strength but has the same intelligence (Golding, 1953, 290; Homer, Odyssey, 2.405-6). \n            </p>\n            <p>\n            This means that The Brain is not a member of the hierarchy who is one of the strongest, but based on their intelligence, not fully incapable of proving themselves to the other members as well. Therefore, Nietzsche’s Apollonian-Dionysian theory can only partially be attributed to these characters since in his theory he discusses how their choices to be civilized are done consciously (Carlevale, 2006, 384). Therefore, one must look at these characters motives for finding themselves at the bottom of the hierarchy. Scholars, Karen May and David Upton describe that characters such as Piggy and Telemachus attach themselves to The Willing Outliers in order to survive the hierarchy itself (May and Upton, 2015, 71). Their lack of physical abilities and heightened intelligence make them subversive to the ‘Dionysian’ actions that less intelligent, and physically capable characters would be more susceptible too but they cannot defend themselves the way The Willing Outlier can. Therefore, though these characters make an intellectual decision to stay outside of the hierarchy, they are still reliant on The Willing Outlier to give them security in that position. Therefore, one can deduce that there is not a strong emphasis on intellectual skills in these Male Social Hierarchy and have a greater emphasis on physical strength.  \n            </p>\n        </div>\n    },\n    {\n        header: 'On the Outskirts Part 3',\n        title: 'No.0',\n        photo: '4.png',\n        position: { x: 0, y: 300 },\n        content: <div>\n            <p>\n            Okay No.4, this is the first actual member of your cohort, No.0, you and the other agreed on not giving him a proper number because he isn’t particularly deserving of it. No.0 is definitely the weak link of the group; he isn’t the sharpest knife in the toolbox, and honestly, not that physically capable either. Nonetheless, he’s here with your group now so there isn’t much you can do about it. Not to mention, he get’s along with the other two outcasts well which doesn’t help much with his reputation. \n            </p>\n            <p>\n            If he were to be compared to any two characters, it would be Simon from Lord of The Flies and Amphinomus from The Odyssey. These characters represent the situation members of The Male Social Hierarchy are trapped in when they find themselves the least capable of the entire group. They can be adopted by The Outcasts, such as when Simon looks up to and relies on Ralph and when Odysseus warns Amphinomus of the massacre that will pursue (Golding, 1953, 92; Homer, Odyssey, 18.145-9). Though this is helpful to them, both these characters end up dying at the end of their respective stories (Golding, 1953, 224; Homer, Odyssey,22.90-4). This demonstrates that without the support of brains or brawn, as mentioned earlier, these individuals could not be successful within The Male Social Hierarchy(Zink et.al, 2008, 273). Even so, both these characters still align themselves with Apollonian thought since they show acts of kindness to the other characters(Carlevale, 2006, 367)  . \n            </p>\n            <p>\n            In all, the factor that contributes to the outliers are their physical and mental abilities as well as the characters alignment with ‘civilized’ or pacifistic tendencies that separate them from the rest of the group. If they cannot defend themselves, they are on the outskirts by default which is separate from those who do so willingly.   \n            </p>\n        </div>\n    },\n    {\n        header: 'Family Part 1',\n        title: 'No. 5',\n        photo: '5.png',\n        position: { x: 50, y: 200 },\n        content: <div>\n            <p>\n            Now that we’ve looked at the bottom of the hierarchy, it is time to discuss your equals No.4. Some of them may be better than you in some ways, but overall, you are all on the same level. If you were to be compared to any character in Lord of The Flies or Homers Odyssey, you would be one of the background characters. This would include Sam and Eric from Lord of The Flies or any of the random suitors from the Odyssey such as Elatus or Ctesippus from the Odyssey. These characters are acknowledged within the story but ultimately unimportant to the plot as individuals. Where their function truly lies is in their ‘character’ as a unit. It highlights the mentality that allows The Male Social Hierarchy to form as well as the post war backing that shaped both these stories. \n            </p>\n            <p>\n            No.5 is another member of the group and to a certain extent, on of your competitors. Scholar Routh Scodel applies a model known as Game Theory to the interactions of the Suitors from Homers Odyssey. Game Theory involves the idea that goals are achieved among the greater collective of The Male Social Hierarchy when they are viewed as a competition where a winner may appear (Scodel, 2001, 308). In the case of the Suitors from The Odyssey, the central game that they play amongst one another is who can marry Penelope, Odysseus’s wife, and through this claim his entire kingdom (Homer, Odyssey, 1.332). This idea of Game Theory can be extended to Lord of The Flies since their task of survival is ultimately treated like a game to engage the younger children of the story (Golding, 1953, 47). Without the use of game theory, these groups would not be able to function and establish one’s place on the social hierarchy. This is directly related to the importance of one’s physical capabilities in the games, as mentioned in the previous section, since many of their tasks require physical effort to be completed. Some examples of this are the boys emphasis on hunting pigs in Lord of the Flies and the suitors show of archery at the end of The Odyssey (Golding, 1953, 44; Homer Odyssey, 21.79-82). \n            </p>\n            <p>\n            Therefore, the use of Game Theory in The Male Social hierarchy unites those who are in the ‘middle’ of the game and establishes everyone’s place and rank among one another. Without the aspect of game theory in the hierarchy, the group would not be able to function since they would have no common motive.  \n            </p>\n        </div>\n    },\n    {\n        header: 'Family Part 2',\n        title: 'No.3',\n        photo: '6.png',\n        position: { x: 250, y: 200 },\n        content: <div>\n            <p>\n            Both Lord of the Flies and Homers Odyssey function in the real world as a coping mechanism for individuals emerging into a post-war era. Lord of The Flies was released after the Second World War and the Odyssey emerged after the Peloponnesian war(Van Vurren, 2004; Palagia, 2009, 35). Both these conflicts were major and changed the states attitude towards society which manifested itself in this fiction, England and Ancient Greece, in ways that could not be reversed. Furthermore, although who Homer really was unknown to anyone living in the contemporary era, William Goulding has been depicted taking a pessimistic view on the healing of a country after war (Van Vuuren, 2004) . Since The Male Social Hierarchy functions in the same manner for both, it can be deduced that the outlook of the story was interpreted in similar ways. Afterall, the suitors come from the generation after Odysseus and, therefore, after the Iliad when a real war was fought. With the ‘War-like’, or even Dionysian, mentality without any real threat forms a cohort that adopts the violent nature seen though both the Suitors and the Choir Boys. \n            </p>\n            <p>\n            For example, the Suitors ‘war’ that they fight is their pursuit of Penelope. Although they look to marry her, they still treat her as a threat and strategize plans to weaken her. This is shown when they realize that the tapestry, she was making was meant to be a delusion to stall her from choosing one of them to marry(Homer, Odyssey, 2.111-6). They attempt to defeat Penelope by threatening to murder her son, Telemachus. In Lord of The Flies, the boys ‘enemy in battle’ is The Beast, a creature that doesn’t exist, yet they are all still determined to hunt down. When The Beast is murdered and revealed to the boys that it was Simon who they had killed, they can only unleash their violence on one another, holding onto their war mindset (Van Vurren, 2004).  \n            </p>\n            <p>\n            Though these actions still function as an aspect of ‘Game Theory’ the violence behind their actions is what demonstrates their war-like mentality. What begins as a challenge between members of the hierarchy quickly divulge into a formation where the men find an opponent to fight to establish their unity but also find a level of safety through their unity. Characters on the outside like Telemachus and Simon who cannot provide them any support or safety are removed by the other members of the hierarchy to maintain their strength as a group for future threats. \n            </p>\n        </div>\n    },\n    {\n        header: 'Family Part 3',\n        title: 'No.2',\n        photo: '7.png',\n        position: { x: 350, y: 200 },\n        content: <div>\n            <p>\n            No.4, I’m sure you have some questions about these people titled your ‘so-called-family’, they’re violent and competitive with one another and don’t seem to have much genuine compassion for one another. So, what makes you guys’ family? Look back to the idea of ‘war mentality’, you all consider each other a cohort because it works to be a means of survival. In other words, you guys are a family because you must be, people on the outskirts are at risk of danger. \n            </p>\n            <p>\n            Both Jack, the leader of The Choir, and Antinous, leader of The Suitors, both make the effort to kill those who are on the outskirts. Jack tries to kill Ralph himself at the end of the novel, pushes the boulder that crushes Piggy and incites the murder of Simon under the impression that he is ‘the beast’(Golding, 1953, 290). Furthermore, Antinous attempts to murder both Telemachus and Odysseus though is unsuccessful on both fronts (Homer, Odyssey, 2.330-7, 22.27-33). Note that in both these situations, they are fully supported by the ‘family’ of the social hierarchy without questioning when these acts are committed. This functions to demonstrate how the ‘games’ the two groups create for themselves further their war like mentality but re-establish who is ‘in’ the group and who is not. How the group continues to function in this manner despite there being no connection is described best by Daniel Levine. \n            </p>\n            <p>\n            Levine focuses on the suitor’s lack of genuine emotion depicted throughout the Odyssey. Specifically, he pays careful attention to the depictions of their laughter. Here, he describes that the laughter the suitors demonstrate is not to show joy or humor at a particular event but rather to demonstrate their group solidarity in a situation (Levine, 1982, 98). When leaders of the hierarchy demonstrate their laughter, it furthers their status as the leaders. Additionally, Levine explains that the laughter is used in a ‘militant’ manner allowing the characters to use it as a ‘battle cry’ before entering a turbulent situation. Therefore, they are seen mainly laughing around Penelope since she is a threat (Ibid). In comparison, the boys in Lord of The Flies express their ‘laughter’ through the ‘play’ in a more overt manner. By describing themselves as a tribe, with battle paint and chants, they re-enforce their group unity in the same manner with Jack as their leader since many of these ideas were his (Golding, 1953, 28).   \n            </p>\n            <p>\n            In all, the use of the ‘family’s’ implementation of ‘Game theory, battle laughter and their militant unity help define the members of their group and create practices that further define them as a singular unit rather than a combination of many individuals. No.4, you don’t need a name greatly different from your cohorts since you are, in essence, the exact same as them.  \n            </p>\n        </div>\n    },\n    {\n        header: 'The Elites Part 1',\n        title: 'No.1',\n        photo: '8.png',\n        position: { x: 450, y: 200 },\n        content: <div>\n            <p>\n            Here we are No.4, making it to the top now. In this final section we’ll explore how these characters have managed to establish their status within the Male Social Hierarchy and what factors allow them to be perceived this way. Furthermore, we will mainly be discussing this through the lens of gender roles that men are forced to play into and how this influences the characters despite their perceived isolation from the rest of society. Afterall, Lord of The Flies was written to be a microcosm, a localized environment of characters interacting to create a larger point about society. Looking at the suitors, the sons of the real warriors form the Iliad stuck on an island where they must face challenges, they create for themselves that help them further their own personal goals. The establishment of their patriarchy can be best seen through the characters relationship to the symbol of pigs, which I argue are inherently feminine in both these works as their establishment of the patriarchy. \n            </p>\n            <p>\n            Stephanie Jamison describes the use of pigs in the Odyssey to be a sign of kingship, which explains why Odysseus takes refuge with the swineherd in the novel (Jamison, 1999, 263). Additionally, it is described that the suitors eaten most of the pigs throughout the duration of the Odyssey more than any of the other animals. This demonstrates their claim on Odysseus’s kingdom through the symbolism of pigs (Ibid). This same concept can be translated to Lord of The Flies since pigs are the central animals the boy’s hunt. The leaders of the hunt, such as Jack are claiming their elite position over the rest of the hierarchy using this action. Characters like Antinous and Jack are the ones to encourage the hunt, which furthers their association with this royal symbol and continues their place at the top of the royal hierarchy. The killing of pigs also acts as a symbol to ‘destroy’ the pre-existing elite structures that were in place before the establishment of The Male Social Hierarchy. By killing the pigs, they are also killing Ralph and Odysseus’s role as an elite actor before the killing of the of the pigs and therefore, the current status quo. \n            </p>\n            <p>\n            In all, the use of pigs in both these stories act to establish the change of power and works to build who would be considered the elites within the male social hierarchy. \n            </p>\n        </div>\n    },\n    {\n        header: 'The Elites Part 2',\n        title: 'The Eye',\n        photo: '9.png',\n        position: { x: 250, y: 100 },\n        content: <div>\n            <p>\n            Arguably, The Eye can be seen as one of the most crucial members in forming The Male Social Hierarchy. While The King, who we’ll discuss later, delegates the tasks for The Family, The Eye is the one who normalizes the Dionysian behavior that the members of the family follow. Normally, this aspect is demonstrated through The Eye’s extreme demonstration of the expectations The King establishes for the rest of The Family to follow in a manner in a manner where the rest of the members beneath him only need to be a fraction as extreme as he is to make a statement. \n            </p>\n            <p>\n            The characters from Lord of The Flies and Homers Odyssey that best represent these two characters are Rodger and Eurymachus respectively. For most of the story, Rodger acts as Jack’s henchman but goes above and beyond in following his orders. There are two prominent examples of this, his extremely violent killing of a female pig and being the one to push the rock that ultimately kills Piggy (Golding, 1953, 276). Eurymachus demonstrates the same extreme behavior when he throws a stool at Odysseus in disguise, an act that is considered violent even to the other suitors (Homer, Odyssey, 19.395). By doing this, these two act as an encouraging nature for the other members of their cohorts to attempt the same behavior. Rifaat Salih describes ‘The Eye’ as characters that are the least connected to their civilized roots, even more than The King (Rifaat, 2019, 42). Therefore, this character functions as the establishing factor of Dionysian views since they are less focused on being charismatic, which is inherently Apollonian unlike the like the king. \n            </p>\n            <p>\n            Without the implementation of The Eye, there is no-one to encourage and oversee the actions of the rest of the family. Additionally, their violence towards The Outsiders re-establishes their place as the most uncivilized and confirms who is and is not allowed within the family. \n            </p>\n        </div>\n    },\n    {\n        header: 'The Elites Part 3',\n        title: 'The King',\n        photo: '10.png',\n        position: { x: 150, y: 0 },\n        content: <div>\n            <p>\n            Here we are No.4, at the top of The Male Social Hierarchy, The King. The King was not always in this position as he had taken the power from the other characters beneath him. Though they may not encourage all these actions, which is attributed to The Eye, they remain at the top for inventing the violent ideas in the first place. The King is not completely out of control of their actions, they are more charismatic and manipulative than those beneath him and also, exhibit strong athletic abilities. Their charisma and talents are the factors which invite the other members of The Male Social Hierarchy to follow him and therefore, allot the most power to the character. \n            </p>\n            <p>\n            Antinous, from the Odyssey, and Jack, from Lord of The Flies, are the members who fill out this role. They are the ones that form the hierarchy after taking the power away from The Willing Outliers. This is shown when Antinous is described as the most likely to court Penelope and when Jack introduces the idea of the hunt (Homer, Odyssey,18-285-290; Golding, 1953,47). When these characters come to power, they simultaneously being the ‘battle mentality’ that the rest of The Family adopts. Tay Fizdale describes Antinous’s charisma through his need to dance with Penelope (Fizdale,1973,457) . This demonstrates his show of charisma since none of the other suitors are seen making romantic gestures such as this towards her to achieve the same goal. Though his actions are not sincere, it demonstrates the higher social capacity he has than the other suitors, placing him as the ‘winner’ of their collective battle and the most socially capable of the suitors. He is also one of the few characters to laugh on his own without the influence of the rest of the group, furthering the example of his social capacity in establishing dominance. Jack also displays these traits by placing emphasis on the boys ‘fun’ rather than completing tasks that would be beneficial to their survival such as building huts. This influences the other choir boys into following him throughout the rest of the story (Golding, 1953, 47). Therefore, one can deduce that the use of charisma places ‘The King’ at the top of the hierarchy and creates the greatest influence over the rest of the characters.  \n            </p>\n            <p>\n            Therefore, we can see that characters at the top of the male Social Hierarchy through their establishment of royal connotations, leadership in social situations and normalization of behavior to the other characters. \n            </p>\n        </div>\n    },\n    {\n        header: 'Conclusion',\n        title: 'The Universal Empire',\n        photo: '10.png',\n        position: { x: 0, y: 0 },\n        content: <div>\n            <p>\n            That’s it No.4, The Male Social Hierarchy: \n            </p>\n            <p>\n            From this information, there are three factors which define this group, the adoption of Dionysian behavior, establishment of group mentality, and the influence from the ‘elites’.
